# RUNE OS ALPHA
## Introduction
runeOS is an experimental operating system. RUNE OS ALPHA is a complete rewrite of it, improving on its cluttered design.

NOTE: This is an official version and is created by the official creators of runeOS.
## How to use
Firstly, download and install the ENTIRE folder. The OS will not work otherwise.

Second, run `main.py`. You will create an account with a username and a password.

You are now ready to experience the capabilities of RUNE OS TEST!

NOTE: As this OS is still in the development stage, don't be surprised if errors jump out at you. Let me know about the error, and we will do our best to fix it.
## Abilities
This OS can:
* manage accounts with passwords
* support apps (packages)*
* and much more!

*Apps are ONLY supported in `ROSA`(RUNE OS ALPHA) format (see `rosa.txt`)
